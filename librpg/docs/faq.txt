To use the librpg module:

    Add the path of the folder that contains the librpg/ folder to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.
    
    To set the PYTHONPATH variable in Windows:

        1. Go to Control Panel -> System -> Advanced.
        2. Click 'Environment Variables' button.
        3. In the 'System Variables' panel that appears, click New and enter PYTHONPATH in the 'Variable Name' field. In the 'Variable Value' field add the full path (eg.: C:\development\python, if librpg is at C:\development\python\librpg) to the end of the value, separated from any other values with ';'.

    To set the PYTHONPATH variable in Linux:
    
        Run the command:
        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:[librpg folder path]
        
        Example, considering that librpg is at /home/username/development/python/librpg:
        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/username/development/python/librpg
