    image: ObjectImage (read-only)
    Image of the MapObject. If this field is None, the object will be invisible.

    map: MapModel (read-only)
    The MapModel in which the MapObject was placed. None is if it not placed in any map.

    position: Position (read-only)
    Where on the map the MapObject is. None if it is not in any map.

    obstacle: int (read-only)
    0 if a party or an object can move over this object, 3 if they can move under it, 1 if it is considered an obstacle. If it is a counter - that is, if push key events may affect objects on the other side of it -, this attribute is set to 2.
    
    facing: Direction (public)
    Direction that the object is facing.
    
    speed: int (public)
    Object speed, in the number of frames to move that object by 1 tile. Use VERY_FAST_SPEED, FAST_SPEED, NORMAL_SPEED, SLOW_SPEED and VERY_SLOW_SPEED.
    
    movement_phase: int (private)
    0 if still, 1 to speed if in the middle of a movement.
