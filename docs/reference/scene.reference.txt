Scene

    A sequence of parallel and sequential events that will be run.
    To use, set it up by inheriting and overloading the constructor
    or just instantiate and set it up normally.

    + Scene()
    
        Set up the SceneActions and their dependencies.
        
    + add_action(action, dependencies)
    
        Adds a new SceneAction to the Scene.
        
        *dependencies* should be a list of the SceneActions on which this
        action depends to start.
        
    + run()
    
        Run the Scene, calling its actions in the right order.
        
        This is actually a mixture of a thread manager with a topological
        sorter. Every iteration, all actions that are not blocked by any
        unfulfilled dependency will be stepped. For each of them that ends
        (step() returns True), the ones that depend on it will have this
        dependency checked, possibly unblocking it.

    -  broadcast_completion(action_id)
        
        Tell the SceneActions waiting for the SceneAction with *action_id*
        that this dependency has been solved.
        
    - active_actions
    
        List of all SceneActions in execution.

    - blocked_actions
    
        Maps action ids to lists of the actions blocked by that id.


SceneAction

    A SceneAction is an atomic action that is part of a scene. It will be
    attributed a unique id to identify it as a dependency for other
    SceneActions. This is an abstract class, inherit from it to create the
    actual SceneActions.
    
    + SceneAction()
    
        Set the id.
        
    - step()
    
        *Abstract.*
        
        Run one iteration of the action. Return whether the action has
        ended and can be completed.

    - dependencies
        
        List of the ids of the SceneActions on which this action depends.
        When a dependency is resolved, it is removed from this list.


IdGenerator

    + IdGenerator()
    
    + get_id()
    
        Return a unique integer id.


ActionSequence(SceneAction)

    + ActionSequence(actions, dependencies)

        A set of SceneActions that will be executed sequentially.
        
        *actions* should be a list of these SceneActions, while
        *dependencies* should be the a list of the dependencies of the
        ActionSequence itself.

Examples
--------

    def activate():
        scene = Scene()
        
        door_movement = MovementAction(self.door,
                                       [Face(UP), Wait(3), Face(LEFT)])
        party_movement = MovementAction(self.party_avatar,
                                       [Step(UP)])
        teleport = TeleportAction(map_id=14, pos=Position(10, 15))
        sequence = ActionSequence([door_movement, WaitAction(6), party_movement,
                                   teleport])
        
        scene.add_action(sequence)
        scene.run()

    def activate():        
        door_movement = MovementAction(self.door,
                                       [Face(UP), Wait(3), Face(LEFT)])
        party_movement = MovementAction(self.party_avatar,
                                       [Step(UP)])
        msg1 = MessageDialog('Hi.')
        teleport = TeleportAction(map_id=14, pos=Position(10, 15))
        wait = WaitAction(16)
        
        scene = Scene()
        scene.add_action(door_movement)
        scene.add_action(msg1, [door_movement])
        scene.add_action(party_movement, [door_movement])
        scene.add_action(wait, [msg1, party_movement])
        scene.add_action(teleport, [wait])
        scene.run()
